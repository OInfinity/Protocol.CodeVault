## Network Engineering Resources

#  Goals
- Network: Master networks (TCP/IP, routing, security).
- Overlap: Build apps that talk to networks (APIs, automation).
- Endgame: Capstone project + portfolio for GitHub.
#  Tools You’ll Use
- Network: Wireshark, Packet Tracer, GNS3, nmap, TryHackMe.
- Free Resources: Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, Professor Messer.
#  Plan Breakdown
- Months 1-2: Foundations (Weeks 1-8)
- Kickstart with basics.

# Key Skills:
- Network: OSI model, IP addressing, HTTP, packet sniffing.
- Milestone: Build a Python script to ping IPs and log results.
- Tasks: Write a factorial program, analyze traffic with Wireshark.
- Months 3-4: Intermediate (Weeks 9-16)
- Level up with integration.

# Key Skills:
- Network: VLANs, routing (OSPF), cybersecurity, Wi-Fi.
- Milestone: Network monitoring tool (Python + Flask).
- Tasks: Call a REST API, configure a router in GNS3.
- Months 5-6: Advanced (Weeks 17-24)
- Master the craft.

# Key Skills:
- Network: SDN, cloud networking (AWS VPC), QoS.
- Milestone: Capstone (e.g., secure chat app with monitoring).
- Tasks: Deploy to AWS, encrypt a file, optimize performance.
#  Highlights
- Week 1: Hello World + ping your router.
- Week 10: Fetch API data + simulate a network.
- Week 19: Encrypt files + sniff HTTPS.
- Week 24: Ship your capstone to GitHub!
#  Next Steps
- Certifications: CCNA, AWS Developer, CompTIA Network+.
- Portfolio: Share projects on GitHub.
- Specialize: Cybersecurity, cloud, or devops.
# Pro Tips
- Consistency: 2-3 hours/day, 5-6 days/week.
- Adapt: Speed up/slow down as needed.
- Practice: Code and configure daily—hands-on is king.
